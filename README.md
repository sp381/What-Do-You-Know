# What-Do-You-Know
A Timed Quiz to test your coding knowledge

This project was given as a challenge through the UofA Bootcamp to test our knowledge of codes thus far. The other test was to apply that learned knowledge and build the timed quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

This quiz has several criterias. They are as follows:
- The timed quiz questions must be about Javascript
- When the start button is clicked a timer starts and the first question pops up. 
- After one questions is answered another will pop up. 
- If a question is answered incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock.
- Once all of the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over.
- After the game is over you are able to save your intials and score.
